# rusty-compression
A low-rank compression library in Rust.

This library provides various routines for the low-rank compression of
linear operators. The algorithms are mostly adapted from the book
*Fast direct solvers for elliptic PDEs* by Gunnar Martinsson.

For examples see the two example programs in the directory `examples`.
